Hi, my name is Eloi Pontual. 
I was born in Recife, Brazil.

I fell in love with computer stuff since i was 11, playing games and seeing how they are developed.
My objective in life is make some game who gonna be something remembered for centuries.
I like to hang out with friends too, but i am terrific chatting with people.
